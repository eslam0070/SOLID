# SOLID

![Image description](https://devx.blog/uploads/programming/intro.png)

is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin).

These principles, when combined together,
make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend.
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, 
and are also a part of the agile or adaptive software development.

## S.O.L.I.D stands for:

When expanded the acronyms might seem complicated, but they are pretty simple to grasp.

## 1. Single-responsibility Principle

A class should have only one job to do.

## 2. O - Open-closed principle

Objects should be open for extension but closed for modification.

## 3. Liskov substitution principle

Every child/sub class should be a substitution to its parent class

## 4. Interface segregation principle

A client should never be forced to implementation an interface or methods doesn't use

## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle

Entities must depend on abstraction not concretion
